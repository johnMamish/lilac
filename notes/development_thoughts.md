Some practical, devleopment-related things that I need to work on resolving:

  (x) I have my collection of random verilog odds and ends that I should put in a seperate repo and include here as a subtree (or submodule)?.
  ( ) I need to figure out how to cleanly use sv2v to synthesize my sv files
  ( ) I need to figure out a directory and testing structure
  ( ) Do I want to use icarus or verilator?
